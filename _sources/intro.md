# Intro to Run-of-River Hydropower

## Preamble

In 2016 I began teaching *EENG 8222: Run-of-River Hydropower* at BCIT.  The first year I taught, I asked students what they liked and disliked about their courses.  The response was unanimous&mdash;students wanted to work on problems that resemble the problems people work on in industry, using the same tools as used in indusutry.  <s>So we spent 12 weeks learning how to format datetime columns in Microsoft Excel.</s>  In response, I set out to create a series of tasks adapted from my work experience in identifying hydropower resources in various places around the world.

Since we only have two sessions, I've adapted a few exercises from my EENG 8222 project curriculum to make this as interactive as possible.  I know some students are working full time, so spending your limited free time watching video lectures is really tough.  I know this because I'm also currently a student.  


 [Jupyter Notebook.](https://jupyter.org/)

In my class, small teams of students develop a proposal for a run-of-river hydropower project.  The proposal is built progressively throughout the term as we cover the material.  The aim of the two sessions I'm with you is to condense the hands-on parts of the course

There are many communities around BC that are not grid connected, typically relying on diesel fuel for electricity supply.  

Important!  We had a private landowner a few years ago approach the class with an information package about his property.  He wanted to develop a micro hydro project on the small creek that ran through his private land.  One group of students took up the challenge to estimate the resource potential, and made a valiant effort.  The owner wasn't happy because we didn't give him the answer he was looking for, **which is a more important result than giving into the temptation to find some perspective that will yield a favourable result**.

This presentation uses the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) format, which is not widely used in industry, but is being adopted widely in academia.  Jupyter Book is basically a way to bring together a bunch of interactive documents with slick formatting.  A calculation file that doubles as a report, where anyone can step into your calculation to check your work or build off an idea.  Below is an example of the type of interactivity that I believe reports can greatly benefit from.  In the subsequent discussion about the hydropower industry in BC, a common criticism is in the use of source information and methodology, and the lack of disclosure of both.  Transparency requires access to information, and Jupyter Book greatly reduces the technological barriers to doing so.
