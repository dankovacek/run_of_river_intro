    "# Estimating Long-Term Runoff using Regional Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll run through a simplified method of estimating runoff at a potential hydropower location in a basin that hasn't been gauged.  We'll use the Python programming language, we'll access data from the Water Survey of Canada, and we'll make a series of estimates of flow based on other rivers in the area where flow has been measured for a long time.  We'll then use the three regional stations to estimate energy at our project location to see how close they are.  \n",

    "Water Survey of Canada is the government organization that maintains a nation-wide network of streamflow monitoring stations.  There are roughly 2100 active monitoring stations in Canada, and while this is a large number, it is small in comparison to the number of streams and rivers, and the distribution of stations is biased to developed areas.\n",
